               <h3>The Midnight Library by Matt Haig</h3>
               <p>life doesn’t miraculously change based on just one choice. There are infinite variables involved with
                    each decision,
                    many of which aren’t in our control.</p>

               <h3>Nine Perfect Strangers by Liane Moriarty</h3>
               <p>“She generally felt that the advice she offered was superior to the advice she received. Other
                    people’s problems were so
                    simple; one’s own problems tended to be so much more nuanced.”
                    ― Liane Moriarty, Nine Perfect Strangers</p>

               <h3>The Anubis Gates by Tim Powers</h3>
               <p>A writer who comes immediately to mind isn’t necessarily unsuccessful or unnoticed, but deserves a lot
                    more cred than he gets, and that is Tim Powers.</p>

               <h3>The Lucifer Effect by Philip Zimbardo</h3>
               <p>It’s a compelling look at how even “normal” people fall into certain roles in situations that many of
                    us can hardly imagine happening (or would like to deny).Scary stuff, but a compelling, eye-opening
                    read.</p>

               <h3>The Skin of Dreams by Raymond Queneau</h3>
               <p>He was examining little bits of doryphoras through the microscope, for the problem was to increase the
                    efficiency of the Baponot Doryphovore [a pesticide manufactured by Jacques’ employer], the
                    insufficiency of which in the business of doryphorotrucidation was beginning to be known among all
                    the farmers of the region.</p>
